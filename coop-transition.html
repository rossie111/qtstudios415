          <h4>Art spaces shouldn’t extract community wealth—they should build community power. We’re figuring out how to make that real.</h4>
          
          <p>At QT Studios, we’re done with "how things are done." The status quo—gentrification, underpaid artists, exploitative creative industries—isn’t inevitable. That’s why we’re in the early stages of researching a transition to a cooperative financial entity, where the queer/trans/BIPOC artists and organizers who sustain this space could collectively govern its future.</p>

          <h4>This isn’t a done deal. It’s a community-led experiment.</h4>

          <p>The QT Studios Steering Committee—a group of artists and organizers—is guiding this exploration, but no final decisions about governance or ownership have been made.</p>

          <h4>Why Explore a Cooperative?</h4>
          <p>Cooperatives are living proof that another economy is possible. While we’re still designing our model, here’s what inspires us:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wealth stays in the community. Revenue could flow back to artists, not landlords.</li>
            <li>Decisions are collective. Policies shaped by those who use the space.</li>
            <li>Permanent roots. A cooperative could protect QT Studios from displacement.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We’re in the messy, exciting phase of figuring out how.</p>
          <p>With guidance from the <a href="https://www.usworker.coop/en/">U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives</a> and tools from <a href="https://start.coop/">Start.coop</a>, the Steering Committee is researching:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Governance models <i>(Who decides what? How are conflicts resolved?)</i></li>
            <li>Membership structures <i>(Who gets a say—and how do they join?)</i></li>
            <li>Ownership transitions <i>(How do we shift equitably?)</i></li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Meet the Steering Committee</h4>

          <p>This group isn’t a board of directors—they’re facilitators of a community process. Their role is to research, propose options, and center your voices:</p>
          <p><b><i>Rossie (they/she)</i></b> is a multidisciplinary artist, drummer, and co-founder of QT Studios, blending radical creativity with cooperative vision. Fresh off earning a certificate in Entrepreneurship & Innovation for media arts, they channel decolonial theory, mestiza queer indigeneity, and anticapitalist strategy into building liberatory spaces—where art, music, and community organizing collide.</p>
          <p><b><i>Norman (they/them)</i></b> is a Black and Indigenous non-binary artist, zine creator, and community facilitator rooted in decolonial collaboration. Through their work with @onzine.tv and alignment with QT Studios’ mission, they cultivate spaces where art and cooperative learning fuel liberation and collective healing.</p>
          <p><b><i>Eddie (he/him)</i></b> is a Latinx preparator at the Asian Art Museum and sound/stage veteran, balancing meticulous art installation by day with raucous guitar and synth for SF’s Queen of Cardboard by night. As QT Studios’ longest-running studiomate, he bridges gallery-grade craft and DIY chaos—always ensuring the show (or exhibit) goes on.</p>
          <p>Their job? To listen, not dictate.</p>

          <h4>How You Can Shape This Future</h4>
          <p>Cooperatives fail without broad participation. Here’s how to get involved now:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Share your needs. What would make a cooperative QT Studios work for you? Email us at qtstudios415@gmail.com</li>
            <li>Follow our Instagram for real-time updates on our research: @qtstudios415</li>
            <li>Support the research. Our Patreon funds this phase. Https://patreon.com/qtstudios415 </li>
          </ol>
          <p>No blueprints, no shortcuts—just collective problem-solving.</p>
          <p>We won’t pretend this is easy. Cooperatives require trust, patience, and unlearning capitalist habits. But if any community can figure it out, it’s ours.</p>
          <p>Stay tuned, stay critical, and stay in the conversation.</p>
